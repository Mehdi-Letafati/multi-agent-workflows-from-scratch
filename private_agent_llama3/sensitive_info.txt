In this paper, conditional denoising diffusion prob-
abilistic models (DDPMs) are proposed to enhance the data
transmission and reconstruction over wireless channels. The
underlying mechanism of DDPM is to decompose the data gen-
eration process over the so-called "denoising" steps. Inspired by
this, the key idea is to leverage the generative prior of diffusion
models in learning a "noisy-to-clean" transformation of the
information signal to help enhance data reconstruction. The pro-
posed scheme could be beneficial for communication scenarios in
which a prior knowledge of the information content is available,
e.g., in multimedia transmission. Hence, instead of employing
complicated channel codes that reduce the information rate,
one can exploit diffusion priors for reliable data reconstruction,
especially under extreme channel conditions due to low signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR), or hardware-impaired communications. The
proposed DDPM-assisted receiver is tailored for the scenario
of wireless image transmission using MNIST dataset. Our
numerical results highlight the reconstruction performance of
our scheme compared to the conventional digital communication,
as well as the deep neural network (DNN)-based benchmark.
It is also shown that more than 10 dB improvement in the
reconstruction could be achieved in low SNR regimes, without
the need to reduce the information rate for error correction.
